Dear marker (❍ᴥ❍ʋ)

I have been so drawn into working for this assignment that I preffered to try and solve all problems on my own. I am aware of the issues the code has: failure in passing the robustness test, and the rather redundant include directives which contain both the .hpp and .cpp files. I have tried different approaches to this, including increasingly complicated makefiles, but in the end I stuck with the simplest solution.
To conclude my inquiry, now that I will righteously get the mark I truly deserve, I would be genuinely happy if you could point me out the mistakes I have done when linking and what could be regarded as conceptuqally wrong in my approach to simulating the rotor's rotations.
